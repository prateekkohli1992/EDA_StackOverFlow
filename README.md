# EDA Stack Overflow

## Objective: EDA of Stackoverflow data to get answers :

When a user raises a question with a data science tag ('python', 'r', 'matlab', 'sas', 'excel', 'sql'), then Stack Overflow sends the notification to the relevant users.

When a user provides a data science tag ('python', 'r', 'matlab', 'sas', 'excel', 'sql') to their question, then Stack Overflow should come up with the expected approximate time to get it answered.

While a user raises a question, Stack Overflow wants to provide some suggestions to the users to get their queries answered quickly.
